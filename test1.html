<p>"This is my first interpretation of real code from scratch. I am a computer programmer that will make it far in life with God by my side. I will soon come up in the industry but for now, I am only just beggining. Coming up won't take me long, and when i'm up there, i'm going to remain steady. For God is my witness, I will be the next biggest multi-billionaire genius and also own my own fortune 500 company. Here's to a bright future!"
